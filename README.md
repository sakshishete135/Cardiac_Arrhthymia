# Cardiac_Arrhthymia

Cardiac arrhythmia is a prevalent heart disorder characterized by irregular heart rhythms, potentially leading to severe health complications and even mortality. The timely and accurate diagnosis of arrhythmia is crucial for effective medical intervention and improved patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic methods may not always capture subtle patterns and complex interactions that underlie arrhythmia, leading to challenges in early detection and treatment.

The problem addressed in this project is to develop a predictive approach using machine learning algorithms to accurately classify cardiac arrhythmia cases based on a comprehensive set of clinical features, including electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements and patient demographics. By creating robust predictive models, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of arrhythmia diagnosis, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions promptly.

Steps Followed:
1. Data Loading
2. Exploratary Data Analysis
3. Algorithm Selection
4. Model Development
5. Model Evaluation

The EDA phase allowed us to gain valuable insights into the dataset, understanding the relationships between variables and identifying potential patterns and correlations. Dropping unneeded columns ensured that only relevant features were considered for the predictive models, streamlining the analysis process.The utilization of various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier, allowed for diverse approaches to arrhythmia prediction. Each algorithm brought its strengths and limitations, contributing to a comprehensive evaluation of predictive performance.
The models were evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the predictive models in accurately classifying cardiac arrhythmia cases, providing valuable decision support for healthcare professionals.
